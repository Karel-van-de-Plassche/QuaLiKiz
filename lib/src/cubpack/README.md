#Introduction

CUBPACK is a package dealing with automatic integration of functions over one or more-dimensional regions.

#Implementation

The package is written in Fortran 95.

We restricted ourselves to a subset of the new language features of Fortran 90. The current version not only compiles successfully with Fortran 95 compilers, but also the F compiler can deal with it.

#Availability

CUBPACK is available in source form for research purposes only. You are free to modify and extend this software, provided full credit is always given to this original and that this file and other information files are always included. You may not ignore the fact that what you see is the result of a very long term project.

Note that anything free comes without guarantee...

#Download

The current distributed version of CUBPACK is able to compute integrals in n dimensions, including n=1. This is the fourth distributed version (October 2002) and comments are very welcome.

The first version was restricted to at most 3 dimensions and was available starting August 1999.
The second version was available starting August 2001.
The third version was available in July 2002.
If you registered and obtained a password (see the section Availability), you can download the Fortran source.
